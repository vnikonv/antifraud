### Project Information:
* This is a Python machine-learning project for detecting fraudulent transactions of clients in banks and MFOs.
* The model was trained on [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushkumarnamdeo/dataset-for-bank-loan-fraud-detection-system).
* This project uses Streamlit for user interface.

### TODO:
1. Create sample datasets for testing model inference.
2. Create Streamlit interface.
    1. Make two pages on Streamlit: training and inference.
    2. Output of inference should be a table with the index of a loan-taker and the value of IsFraud for the selected model.
    3. On training page, user should be able to select which model to use.
